:page-partial:

The following example shows you how to import into Studio an existing project from Exchange, and then record the processing of a flow to create a unit test for the flows.

== Prerequesite

* You have your Anypoint Platform credentials configured in Studio. +
See xref:studio::set-credentials-in-studio-to.adoc[Configuring Anypoint Platform Credentials] for more information.

== Testing the Login Form Using the HTTP Connector Example

. Click the *Open Exchange* icon image:exchange-icon.png[3%,3%].
. Select *Provided by MuleSoft* in the pop-up Exchange window, filter per *Examples* and look for the *Login Form Using the HTTP Connector*.
. Click the *Open* button. +
Studio imports the example as a new working project.
** If prompted, select to *Perform Update*  in the *Update your Workspace* option.
. Select the *Manage Mule Projects APIs* icon image:manage-project-api-icon.png[2%,2%].
. Select *Modules* and update both *MUnit* and *Munit Tools*.
+

. Select *Apply and Close*.

=== Testing a Successful Login

//tag::this-test[]
. In your project, right-click the `DoLoginFlow`, and select > *Munit* > *Record new test for this flow (BETA)*.
+

+
The test recorder starts your project and starts recording the event going through that flow.
. Open a browser and navigate to `+http://0.0.0.0:8081/login+`.
//end::this-test[]
. In *Username* type `_mule_`, in *Password* type `_mule_`, and click *Submit*. +
//tag::also-this[]
The test recorder captures this event and stops the recording.
. Back in Studio, click *Configure Test*.
+

. Select the file name for the MUnit test suite in which you want to record your test.
//end::also-this[]
. Under *Test name*, type `_DoLoginFlow-successfull_`
. Set the test recorder to set the recorded input of the flow, and assert that the recorded output is the expected output by the test.
. In the *Successful login* parse template step, select *Verify that this process was called* and set the counter to *equal to* `_1_` time.
. Click *Next* and then *Finish*.
+
A fully functional MUnit test is generated to assert that the process in your application works as expected when the login is successful.

=== Testing an Unsuccessful Login

include::page$test-recorder-examples.adoc[tag=this-test]
. In *Username* type `_admin_`, in *Password* type `_admin_`, and click *Submit*. +
include::page$test-recorder-examples.adoc[tag=also-this]
. Under *Test name*, type `_DoLoginFlow-unsuccessfull_`
. Set the test recorder to set the recorded input of the flow, and assert that the recorded output is the expected output by the test.
. In the *Unsuccessful login* parse template step, select *Verify that this process was called* and set the counter to *equal to* `_1_` time.
. Click *Next* and then *Finish*.
+
A fully functional MUnit test is generated to assert that the process in your application works as expected when the login fails.
