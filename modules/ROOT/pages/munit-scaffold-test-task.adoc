To automatically generate an MUnit test suite from an API definition, you need to have a project generated using APIkit:

. Find your APIKit Router in your project and right click on it.
. Select *Create Test Suite For Project From RAML*.

APIkit automatically scaffolds an MUnit test suite based on the endpoints described on your API definition.
