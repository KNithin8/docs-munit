MUnit allows you to test your Mule Applications that run referencing a Mule Domain. Since Mule 4, testing these
applications requires no special configuration, working the same way as testing a regular Mule Application. +
MUnit handles running the domain automatically, so the test should be created as if the domain was part of your
application.
