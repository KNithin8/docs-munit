The MUnit Coverage feature provides a measurement of how much of a Mule application has been executed by a set of MUnit tests by counting the amount of event processors executed. This allows you to obtain a quality standard for your application, and provides metrics for:

* Application overall coverage: An average of the items below.
* Resource coverage: Refers to each Mule configuration file under src/main/mule.
* Flow coverage: Refers to any of the following components: Flows, Sub-flows, and Batch jobs.

Coverage report runs only for EE edition runtimes. If your application has a `requiredProduct` of a Mule CE runtime you will see the following message: *Coverage is a EE only feature and you've selected to run over CE*. To run against an EE runtime see xref:munit-maven-plugin.adoc#specify-runtime-product[Specifying the Runtime Product].

The following is a coverage report sample in JSON format. +
Use the code callouts below to understand each field in the report:

== Enabling Coverage Reports in Anypoint Studio

The Coverage button in the image bellow allows you to see which flows, and which percentage of event processors in those
flows were covered by the test:

The Overall Coverage value represents the percentage of the Mule application event processors that have been executed by the MUnit test.

You can click the Generate Report button to get the report detailing the flows and event processors contained by the Mule configuration files that were included in the MUnit test.

| Column      | Description
| Resource    | The name of the Mule Configuration file.
| Containers | Number of Flows inside the Mule configuration file.
| Weight      | This field represents how much of your application is contained inside a configuration file. +
                It is calculated as a percentage of the overall number of event processors in the documentation and the
                amount of event processors contained in the Mule configuration file.
| Coverage    | This field represents the percentage of the event processors inside the Mule Configuration file that
                were executed in the MUnit test.

Additionally you can click in each Resource, to get a more specific and granular report of the Event Processors executed in that resource:

| Name                | The name of the container.
| Type                | The type of the container.
| Covered Processors | The processors inside the container that were executed during the MUnit test.
| Processors         | The total amount of processors inside the container.
| Coverage            | This field represents the percentage of the event processors inside the container that were executed in the MUnit test.

== Disabling Coverage Reports

If you choose so, you can disable the coverage calculation from your project's run configuration.

Right click in your Package Explorer, and choose *Run As* and *Run Configurations...*, select your MUnit run configuration file to access your suite's configuration, and deselect the "Run coverage" option under your coverage settings.
