The Verify Event Processor allows you to verify if a processor was called.

For example, you can validate if a specific message processor has been called with a particular set of attributes a specific number of times.

When defining a verification, you are telling MUnit to fail a test if the verification is not successful.

You can define verifications over any message processor, even if you haven't created a mock for it.

|Attribute Name |Description

|`eventProcessor`
|Describes which event processor you want to mock. The description takes the form `{name-space}:{event-processor-name}`. It supports regular expressions.

|`times`
|*(Default = 1.)* Defines the verification as successful if the event processor was called _N_ and only _N_ number of times.

|`atLeast`
|Defines the verification as successful if the event processor was called a minimum of _N_ number of times.

|`atMost`
|Defines the verification as successful if the event processor was called maximum of _N_ number of times.

|===

[NOTE]
--
The attributes `times`, `atLeast`, `atMost`, are mutually exclusive. Only one should be used.
--

The `eventProcessor` attribute accepts regular expressions. You could create the same verification as .*:request.
In this example, we define a verification for a event processor named request, disregarding which namespace the event processor belongs to.

The regular expression language is the same as Java.
