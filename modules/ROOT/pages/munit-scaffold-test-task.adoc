You can use APIKit to automatically generate an empty structure for an MUnit test suite based on your API specification.

Using APIKit does not generate a test, but it helps you to start writing one.

Your Mule project must be generated using APIKit.

. Find the APIKit Router in your project and right click on it.
. Select *Create Test Suite For Project From RAML*.

APIkit automatically scaffolds an empty MUnit test suite based on the endpoints described on your API definition.
