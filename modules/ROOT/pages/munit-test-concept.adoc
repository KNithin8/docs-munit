== MUnit Test Suite

The base file in MUnit is the MUnit Test Suite file, the XML file located in the `src/test/munit` directory of your Mule application's folder structure. You can have as many MUnit Test Suite files as you need. Each MUnit Test Suite file is a collection of MUnit tests, and runs independently from other MUnit Test Suites.

An MUnit Test Suite can contain any combination of the following components:

* Before/After Suites
* Before/After Tests
* MUnit Tests

Each MUnit Test Suite is, behind the scenes, no different than a Mule configuration file. You can use several of the Mule top level elements such as flow, sub-flow, and scripts.

== MUnit Test

The MUnit Test is the basic processor of an MUnit Test Suite. It represents each test scenario you want to try.

The MUnit Test is divided in three scopes. All of them are optional:

[%header,cols="20,80"]
|===
|Scope |Description

| Behavior
| The behavior scope is meant to set all the preconditions before executing the test logic. +
Mocks and Spies should go in this section.

| Execution
| The execution scope is meant to have the testing logic which will wait for all processes to finish before executing the next scope.

| Validation
| The validation scope is meant to have all the validations regarding the result of the execution scope. +
Assertions and Verifications should go here.

=== MUnit Test Description Attribute

In MUnit, you must write a description for your test. Ideally, you should write a useful, representative description of the scenario you are testing. This description displays in the test console before running the test, and also in the reports. The more representative the description, the easier to read and troubleshoot any failures.

=== Ignoring a Test

There may be scenarios where you need to shut down a test. Whether this be because the test is failing or because it has inconvenient side effects. MUnit allows you to ignore a specific test so that you don't have to manually comment out the code.

You can ignore any of your tests by adding the ignore boolean to the test definition.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test name="my-flow-Test"
      ignore="true"
      description="Test to verify scenario 1">
</munit:test>
----

[TIP]
Valid values for `ignore` are true and false. If the attribute is not present, the default is false.

.In Anypoint Studio, you can check the Ignore Test option.

=== Test Tag Attribute

MUnit allows you to tag your tests, so you can choose to run tests under a specific tag. For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test
  name="exampleTest"
  description="A test that works as an example"
  ignore="true"
  tags="integration,http" >
		â€¦
</munit:test>
----

.In Anypoint Studio, you can define tags in the proper field.

=== MUnit Test Expected Error and Exception Attributes

Assume that you want to validate that the flow or sub-flow you are testing fails and throws a specific error. MUnit allows you to add the attributes `expectedErrorType` and `expectException` as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test name="MUnit-test-suite"
  description="A test that works as an example"
  expectedErrorType="RETRY_EXHAUSTED"
  expectedException="java.lang.RuntimeException"
  expectedErrorDescription="retries exhausted">
  ...
</munit:test>
----

.A visual representation on Anypoint Studio
image::munit-test-concept-e7280.png[]

* The `expectedErrorType` attribute expects an error ID that needs to be defined inside the application being tested. +
 This attribute allows you to validate that a defined error type in your application is thrown. If you define an `errorType` that does not exists in your application, the test does not run.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test name="MUnit-test-suite"
  description="Test Error Type"
  expectedErrorType="FTP:ILLEGAL_PATH">
  ...
</munit:test>
----
+
This Error Type test expects that an FTP operation will throw an `FTP:ILLEGAL_PATH` error. +
If none of your flows are using an FTP connector, then the error type is not defined within your application and the test will not run.
+
[TIP]
ErrorTypes that belong to the Mule Runtime do not need to be typified. For example, `MULE:RETRY_EXHAUSTED` can be defined as `RETRY_EXHAUSTED`.

* The attribute expectException expects a literal exception class name (canonical form).
 When you provide a literal value, it should take the form of the canonical class name of the exception that is expected. In these cases, Mule always throws a `MuleMessagingException`. MUnit validates the provided classname if the underlying cause of the `MuleMessagingException` thrown is of the exact same type.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:test name="testExceptions"
  description="Test Exceptions"
  expectedException="java.lang.RuntimeException">
  ...
</munit:test>
----
+
If you define that your test expects an exception and none is thrown, the test fails immediately.

== Before / After Scopes

As with other testing frameworks, MUnit provides a set of scopes that allow you to add processing or actions to run before and/or after the entire MUnit Test or MUnit Test Suite execute:

* Before and After Suite Scopes.
* Before and After Test Scopes.

The ID field for each component must be unique across all your application. The before and after scopes cannot share the same name between them, nor have the same name as any flow in your application.

See xref:before-after-scopes-reference.adoc[Before/After scopes] reference for more information.
