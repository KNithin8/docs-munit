The Assert That Event Processor allows you to run assertions in order to validate the state of a Mule Event's content. +
This Event Processor can be used to validate the Mule Event after the production code runs.

For example, to assert that a payload is equal to a certain value, you can configure the Assert-That processor using the equalTo() matcher.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit-tools:assert-that
  expression="#[payload]"
  is="#[MunitTools::equalTo('example')]"
  message="The payload should be ‘example’"/>
----

Or you can also check if the payload is null using the nullValue() matcher.


[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit-tools:assert-that
  expression="#[payload]"
  is="#[MunitTools::nullValue()]"
  message="The payload is null"/>
----

If these assertion fails, the processor throws a `java.lang.AssertionError`.
