You can use APIKit to automatically generate an empty structure for an MUnit test suite based on your API specification.

This process does not generate a functional implementation of a test. It is meant to make it easier for you to start writing an MUnit test.

Your Mule project must be generated using APIKit.

. Find the APIKit Router in your project and right click on it.
. Select *Create Test Suite For Project From RAML*.

APIkit automatically scaffolds an empty MUnit test suite based on the endpoints described on your API definition.
